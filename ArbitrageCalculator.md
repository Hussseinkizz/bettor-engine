For teams A and B, each with a winning odd of x and y respectively...

(i) Get percentage of each odd, that's to say:

for A% = (1/x)  times 100 and for B% = (1/y) times 100

(ii) Get total percentage of each odd's percentage got from step (i), that is:

Total Percent, TP% = A% + B%

(iii) Assuming any stake $Z or atleast 1 USD or Shs,
The assumed winning stake split for Team A would be...

The assumed stake $Z times total odd percentage of A, A% then divided by the total percentage TP%

Hence:
A' = ($Z)x(A%) / TP%
B' = ($Z)x(A%) / TP%

(iv) Then the possible return for a bet on team A would be,
A' times A's odd x to give final return profit R.A and hence:
R.A = (A') times (x) and R.B = (B') times (y)

(v) Then the profit margin for a bet at A would be the final return profit minus the orignal stake $Z and hence:
For A, profit margin P.M.A = (R.A - $Z) and P.M.B = (R.B - $Z)

(vi) The average grand profit of A and B odds is the average of P.M.A and P.M.B converted to percentage hence:
Grand Profit, GP% = (P.M.A + P.M.B) divided by total number of odds or items, 2 in this case and then times (1/100) percent!
For example, for A's odd 2.25 and B's odd 1.9 the percentage is 3.01% and abitrage exists only if the GP% is not negative!

And the above calculations in step (v) determine how much a bettor gets on placing at any of the odds that have for say a 3.01% arbitrage!
